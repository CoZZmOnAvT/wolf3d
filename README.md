# Wolf3D

Represantation of old Wolfenstein3D (1992). Project fully written in C. Myself I had added some interestion feateres like:
 - Console
 - MLG Effect if you pick Doritos chips package
 - High resolution textures
 - Simple map managment

Truly, it's simply engine on which you can build own game, you can replace textures files and rebuild levels with text editor.
Also, you can replace music files with your own soundtracks.

You can add some new high resolution sprites to make enemies more horrible and detailed.
All resources you can find in `resources` folder.
